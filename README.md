# Stardust SWG: Based on SWGEmu Core3 / Engine3 #

## What is Stardust? ##

Put simply,  Stardust is a take on Pre-NGE Star Wars Galaxies with a primary focus on combat balance, quick, fast paced combat, challenging gameplay, and an overall content experience that you will not get anywhere else.

If you are tired of servers that cater to people that whine for an easy mode experience, watering down essential components of the game in the name of “Quality of Life”,  you may have come to the right place.

## Why do we share ALL of our Source? ##

Aside from the terms of the AGPL Licensing, it is our philosophy that good work should be shared.   If that means that other servers and projects borrow or steal from us (depending on how you look at it), that is fine with us.   Imitation is supposedly the highest form of flattery, and if what we have is good enough to take.  Take it.   After all none of this would be possible without the hard work that was freely given by the flagship SWGEmu project.    

To not share what we do, completely, and totally as the SWGEmu team does.   Well, would be damned hypocritical.   We do not share the paranoia some other server admins feel that they need to protect what works they have done in order to keep people on their server.  We feel that our work speaks for itself, but the way we run our server and manage our community will speak even louder and keep members of our community content.

## Additional dependencies ##

This modified Core3 Repository utilizes the ModTheGalaxy Client TRE Files instead of the stock TRE Files included with the retail client. They are available for download from modthegalaxy.com, or directly from https://mega.nz/#F!fw0EzZ4I!RfRwyqE859Ad3kGlQv7T4Q

Additionally there are specific TRE files native only to Stardust that are distributed through our launcher utility.  Download them from our website at www.stardust-swg.com  or directly from here:

Stardust_01.tre  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S6ZbmLkPhwrhzpryeR-5x4MLCAwBZrSG

Stardust_02.tre  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GEGUyQGN5dZgfg7Ili7b-tOLA4oZrq9w

Stardust_03.tre  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JaI1FE-xBYNeQvh6pPiv5EtUthDhlNiM

## PublicEngine ##

Stardust is dependent on a specific version of SWGEmu's PublicEngine and will not function with later versions of it in an as-is state.    A fork of this version is available at https://github.com/Levarrishawk/PublicEngine

## Pre-Built Development Environment ##
We have packaged together a pre-built Virtual Machine. based on the ZonamaDev VM for Third Party Developers to contribute to this project for use in both testing and development, or if they so chose to start their own server based on Stardust.   It is already set to work with this repository.    

Disclaimer:  Portions of the EmuYoda application will break this VM by auto-updating the engine version.   I do not suggest using them for anything.

Bear in mind, we will not provide support for anyone who creates their own server based on this work.   With that said, here is the download link.
